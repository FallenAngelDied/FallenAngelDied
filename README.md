- 👋 Hi, I’m @FallenAngelDied also known as Erin. That was lame, but I'm going to keep it. 
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and datasets based on games, I also have an interest in horror, the weird and the dark side of analytics. 🎮
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the analytics world of coding. I developed an interest when I was on a project with my former employer, Accenture, where I worked on trixes, create datasets and clean data. I love the research aspect and creating visualizations and letting the client know of the findings or of anything new that maybe trending and why it is trending.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I'm not sure yet, I am new to this site, as I use Kaggle more (just happened to be the site I started with.)
- 📫 How to reach me at my email: erin.young0710@gmail.com 🔮
