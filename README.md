- 👋 Hi!
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and datasets based on games, I also have an interest in horror, the weird and the dark side of analytics. 🎮
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the analytics world of coding. I developed an interest when I was on a project with my former employer, Accenture, where I worked on trixes, create datasets and clean data. I love the research aspect and creating visualizations and letting the client know of the findings or of anything new that maybe trending and why it is trending.
- 💞️ I use to GitHub as an extra space for some of my data works, and often use other site or just notebooks such as, Jupyter or Kaggle, as they feel a little more aligned to what I do and where my interestes lie.
